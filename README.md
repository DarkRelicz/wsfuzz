WebSocket Fuzzer
WebSocket Fuzzer is a Python script that enables you to perform various types of attacks, such as XSS, SQL injection, command injection, and file inclusion, on WebSocket-based web applications. The script allows you to customize the target URL, payload, encoding scheme, and other parameters.

Installation
Clone the repository or download the wsfuzz.py script.
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
The script can be executed using the following command:

shell
Copy code
python wsfuzz.py <attack> [options]
Replace <attack> with the type of attack you want to carry out (xss, sqli, cmdi, or lfi).

Attack Options
The available options depend on the attack type. Here are the common options:

-t, --target: Specify the target WebSocket URL. Default values are provided for each attack, but you can customize it as needed.
-r, --request: Specify the format of an example request. Use curly braces {} to represent dynamic parts that will be replaced by payloads. Default values are provided for each attack, but you can customize it as needed.
-p, --payload: Specify the payload file to use. Default payload files are provided for each attack, but you can provide your own.
-e, --encode: Specify the encoding scheme to use for payloads. Choose from none, base64, hex, or url. Default is none.
Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the script:

XSS attack:
shell
Copy code
python wsfuzz.py xss -t ws://example.com/xss -r "*" -p payloads/xss.txt -e none
SQL injection attack:
shell
Copy code
python wsfuzz.py sqli -t ws://example.com/authenticate-user -r '{"auth_user":"*","auth_pass":""}' -p payloads/sqli.txt -e base64
Command injection attack:
shell
Copy code
python wsfuzz.py cmdi -t ws://example.com/command-execution -r "127.0.0.1*" -p payloads/cmdi.txt -e none
File inclusion attack:
shell
Copy code
python wsfuzz.py lfi -t ws://example.com/file-inclusion -r "*" -p payloads/lfi.txt -e none
Customization
You can customize the target URL and payloads by modifying the default values provided in the script. Refer to the respective attack sections in the script to make the necessary changes.
